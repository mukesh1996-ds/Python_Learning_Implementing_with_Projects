# Python

Python is a popular programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991.

It is used for:

* `web development (server-side),`
* `software development,`
* `mathematics,`
* `system scripting.`


**What can Python do?**

* Python can be used on a server to create web applications.
* Python can be used alongside software to create workflows.
* Python can connect to database systems. It can also read and modify files.
* Python can be used to handle big data and perform complex mathematics.
* Python can be used for rapid prototyping, or for production-ready software development.


**Why Python?**

* Python works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc).
* Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language.
* Python has syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than some other programming languages.
* Python runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written. This means that prototyping can be very quick.
* Python can be treated in a procedural way, an object-oriented way or a functional way.

**Good to know**

* The most recent major version of Python is Python 3, which we shall be using in this tutorial. However, Python 2, although not being updated with anything other than security updates, is still quite popular.
* In this tutorial Python will be written in a text editor. It is possible to write Python in an Integrated Development Environment, such as Thonny, Pycharm, Netbeans or Eclipse which are particularly useful when managing larger collections of Python files.

**Python Syntax compared to other programming languages**

* Python was designed for readability, and has some similarities to the English language with influence from mathematics.
* Python uses new lines to complete a command, as opposed to other programming languages which often use semicolons or parentheses.
* Python relies on indentation, using whitespace, to define scope; such as the scope of loops, functions and classes. Other programming languages often use curly-brackets for this purpose.

**Python Comments**

* Comments can be used to explain Python code.
* Comments can be used to make the code more readable.
* Comments can be used to prevent execution when testing code.

**Python Variables**

* Variables are containers for storing data values. A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it. Variables do not need to be declared with any particular type, and can even change type after they have been set.

* `Casting:` If you want to specify the data type of a variable, this can be done with casting.

* `Get the Type:` You can get the data type of a variable with the `type()` function.

* `Single or Double Quotes:` String variables can be declared either by using single or double quotes

* `Case-Sensitive:` Variable names are case-sensitive.

* `Variable Names:` A variable can have a short name (like x and y) or a more descriptive name (age, carname, total_volume). Rules for Python variables:

    * A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
    * A variable name cannot start with a number
    * A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
    * Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)
    * A variable name cannot be any of the Python keywords.
    * Python allows you to assign values to multiple variables in one line
                        `x, y, z = "Orange", "Banana", "Cherry"`
    * If you have a collection of values in a list, tuple etc. Python allows you to extract the values into variables. This is called unpacking.
